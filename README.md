# eNewton Bracelet Builder

Internal bracelet design tool for composing, saving, reviewing, and publishing bracelet configurations. Designers place 3D bead/charm models onto a virtual bracelet, manage designs through a multi-stage approval workflow, and publish finalized designs with Shopify SKUs.

## Design Workflow

Designs move through a multi-stage approval pipeline:

```
draft → in_review → approved → published
  ↑        │            │
  └────────┘            │
  (rejected)            │
                        ↓
                   discontinued
                        ↓
                   (undiscontinued → published)
```

Each transition requires specific permissions and uses a dedicated API endpoint. The `usePermissions` hook centralises all role checks. Rejected designs include a `rejection_reason` displayed on the canvas and in the details dialog. Editing a rejected design auto-resets its status to draft on the server.

## Edit Locking

Concurrent editing is prevented via server-side edit locks with a 30-second heartbeat. When a user loads a design, `useLoadDesign` acquires the lock via `POST /designs/:id/lock`. The `useDesignHeartbeat` hook sends keepalive POSTs every 30 seconds. If another user (typically an admin) force-takes the lock, the original editor is kicked to read-only mode and shown a `SessionTakenOverDialog`.

Pusher events (`design.lock-taken`, `design.lock-changed`) provide instant notification of lock changes, supplementing the heartbeat polling.

## Real-time Updates (Pusher)

Each design has a private Pusher channel (`private-design-{id}`) carrying events for design updates, lock changes, and comment CRUD. The `usePusherDesign` hook subscribes when a design is loaded and writes event payloads directly into the React Query cache via `setQueryData` to avoid redundant network round-trips. The global `private-designs` channel carries `design.status-changed` events that update notification badge counts.

## 3D Scene Architecture

The scene renders inside a React Three Fiber `<Canvas>` with `camera-controls` for orbit/zoom. Key components:

- **BeadOnBracelet** — Loads GLB via `useGLTF`, applies material finish presets (gold/silver/rose_gold), handles charm hanging via bounding-box measurement, and renders selection rings and drag targets.
- **SpacerOnBracelet** — Procedural wireframe cylinder (no GLB). Visible only in draft/rejected states; suppressed during thumbnail capture.
- **BraceletCord** — Torus (3D view) or cylinder (line view) with material-specific properties. Hairtie cord color is user-selectable.
- **CameraController** — Manages transitions between free orbit, bead zoom, top-down edit, side edit, and line view modes.
- **CameraOffset** — Applies view offset to keep the bracelet centred when side panels slide open.

Two canvas layouts are supported: circular (torus in XZ plane) and line (straight along X axis). The `bead-layout.ts` module computes per-bead transforms for both, using actual bead diameters and per-category spacing rules.

## Bead Administration

Admins can manage the bead catalog via `ManageBeadsDialog`:

- Create/edit bead products with metadata (name, SKU, category, material, dimensions)
- Upload GLB models to S3 with client-side validation (extension, size, magic bytes)
- Capture bead thumbnails from a preview R3F canvas
- Toggle active/inactive status (soft delete)
- Permanently delete beads (409 conflict when referenced by designs)

## Thumbnail Generation

Bracelet thumbnails are captured via `useGenerateThumbnail`:

1. Spacer wireframes are hidden (`spacersHiddenForCapture`)
2. Two rAF ticks wait for React to flush the state change
3. A cloned camera renders from `CAMERA_DEFAULT_POSITION` into a `WebGLRenderTarget`
4. Pixel data is read, row-flipped (WebGL→Canvas origin), and content-aware cropped
5. The cropped image is scaled to a 600×600 PNG and uploaded to S3

Thumbnails are only regenerated when the visual content changes (beads, size, material). Name-only or description-only edits reuse the existing thumbnail.

## Environment Variables

### Required (Runtime)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | PHP API base URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY` | localStorage key for auth token |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_APP_KEY` | Pusher application key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER` | Pusher cluster (default: `mt1`) |

### Required (Server-side / Build)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ENEWTON_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS credentials for S3 uploads |
| `ENEWTON_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS credentials for S3 uploads |
| `ENEWTON_AWS_REGION` | AWS region for S3 bucket |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME` | S3 bucket name for models/thumbnails |

### Optional

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `S3_PUBLIC_URL` | CloudFront/custom domain for S3 assets |

Note: AWS env vars use the `ENEWTON_` prefix because AWS reserves `AWS_*` names on certain platforms (including Netlify). `S3_BUCKET_NAME` and `S3_PUBLIC_URL` are server-side only and not available at Netlify build time when marked as "Secret".

## Design Tokens

Defined in `globals.css` under `@theme`:

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `navy` | `#1F3A5F` | Primary actions, headers |
| `gold` | `#a38d48` | Accent, selection highlight |
| `mint` | `#e2ffff` | Secondary backgrounds, hover states |
| `light-mint` | `#D8F0ED` | Positive action buttons |
| `blush` | `#F7D9DD` | Soft danger, type filter chips |
| `stone` | `#9b948e` | Muted text, borders |
| `shell` | `#f6f3ee` | Tooltip backgrounds, subtle surfaces |
| `error` | rose-700 | Error states, danger buttons |
| `orange` | `#c0774a` | Warning banners (lock/kicked) |

Typography uses three font families: Inter (body), Italiana (headlines), and Square Peg (display/decorative).

## Key Patterns & Conventions

- **Targeted diffs over full rewrites** — Prefer minimal, focused changes rather than wholesale component rewrites.
- **Consolidation over file proliferation** — Hooks, components, and utilities are merged when they share logic (e.g., `Tags.ts`, `Collections.ts`, `Pickers.tsx`).
- **Feature flags for backend stubs** — Features awaiting API work use feature flags or stubs (e.g., `REJECT_ENDPOINT_READY`).
- **PHP API quirks** — The backend returns empty strings and zero-dates instead of null; `apiFetch` guards against non-JSON error responses from Apache/PHP.
- **Tailwind dynamic classes** — Computed class strings don't survive JIT; use inline `style` props with shared constants instead.
- **React hooks ordering** — All hooks must appear unconditionally before any early `return null` statements.
- **Camera UX** — Minimal camera movement with natural transitions; avoid disorienting scripted repositioning.
- **GLB convention** — Bead hole axis is local Y. Charms need pivot at bail top, Y-up, face +Z (standardisation in progress with 3D modeler).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Local PHP API testing uses MAMP. Database access via TablePlus or phpMyAdmin.

## Deployment

Frontend deploys to Netlify. The `next.config.mjs` rewrites proxy `/models/*` and `/images/*` to the S3 bucket so the frontend never makes cross-origin requests for 3D assets and thumbnails.
